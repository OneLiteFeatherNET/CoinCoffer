## What is CoinCoffer ?

CoinCoffer is a prototype plugin with the base of [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) and hold together with [Glue](https://github.com/OneLiteFeatherNET/Glue) to test Glue, our git patcher for functionality.
The name CoinCoffer is a name game (also ChatGPT approved) as we tried to find a similar name to Vault.

### Is there a download?
Soon, not yet but you will find it on [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/) then.

### Where can I ask questions?
There might be a dedicated channel in the future on our Discord, but at the moment, you are fine with the [#need-help Channel](https://discord.onelitefeather.net) here.
Don't forget to accept the rules with an emote on the #discord-rules channel, then the #need-help channel is visible for you.
